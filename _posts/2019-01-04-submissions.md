We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community. 

## Format

Submissions should be a minimum length of 8 pages and no longer than 10 
pages. The page limit includes figures, tables, and your appendices, but 
does not include references, for which there is no page limit. Papers should 
be submitted in PDF format. We kindly refer authors to the Springer 
guidelines below for paper templates.

All submissions should be made electronically through the SC19 <a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org">Submissions
website</a>.  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Authors should consult Springerâ€™s <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"> author's guidelines </a> and use their <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"> proceedings 
templates</a>, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. 
Springer encourages authors to include their <a href="https://goo.gl/nAX4y8"> ORCIDs </a> in their papers. In addition, 
the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of 
that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding 
author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on 
the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the 
authorship of the papers cannot be made.
