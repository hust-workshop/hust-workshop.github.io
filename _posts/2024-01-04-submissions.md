We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC community.

## Format

All submissions should be made electronically through the SC24 <a href="https://submissions.supercomputing.org">Submissions website</a>.
Papers should be submitted as PDF file using the **IEEE proceedings template**.
We kindly refer authors to the necessary [templates](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to earlier work.
When discussing past work, they need to refer to themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another researcher's work.
Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of interest with the PC chair or PC members.

We are accepting:
- Full papers, 6-12 pages including figures, tables, and references.
  Full papers **will** be included in the published proceedings.
