#### Held in conjunction with [Supercomputing](http://sc24.supercomputing.org):  The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis.

### Overview

Supercomputing centers exist to drive scientific discovery by supporting
researchers in computational science fields. To make users more productive in the
complex HPC environment, HPC centers employ user support teams. These teams
serve many roles, from setting up accounts, to consulting on math libraries and
code optimization, to managing HPC software stacks. Often, support teams struggle
to adequately support scientists. HPC environments are extremely complex, and
combined with the complexity of multi-user installations, exotic hardware, and
maintaining research software, supporting HPC users can be extremely demanding.

With the eleventh HUST workshop, we will continue to provide a necessary forum for
system administrators, user support team members, tool developers, policy makers
and end users. We will provide a forum to discuss support issues and we will provide
a publication venue for current support developments. Best practices, user support
tools, and any ideas to streamline user support at supercomputing centers are in
scope.
