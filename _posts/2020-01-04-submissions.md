We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with
sufficient background material to be clear to the HPC
community.

## Format

All submissions should be made electronically through the SC20 <a
href="https://sc20.supercomputing.org/submit/">Submissions
website</a>.  Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should
remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to
earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to
themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another
researcher's work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of
interest with the PC chair or PC members.

Format details coming soon.
