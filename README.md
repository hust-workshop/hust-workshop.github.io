## Layout of this repo

This site uses sections within a single page, where each page is particular year.
The sections come from the files in the `_posts` folder.
The date in the file name determines on which page the text will appear.

### Year Page

To create a page for all the sections of a single year, use the following (with the appropriate year):

```
---
layout: default
year: 20XX
---
```

### Page Sections

The sections of the page are posts within that year and appear in reverse-date order (oldest appear at the top).

The organization of the sections is:
- `20XX-01-01-intro.md`: Site intro.
- `20XX-01-02-program.md`: Workshop program.
- `20XX-01-03-topics.md`: Workshop topics.
- `20XX-01-04-submissions.md`: Submission format.
- `20XX-01-05-dates.md`: Deadlines.
- `20XX-01-06-committee.md`: Names and institutions of the committee members.
- `20XX-01-07-slides.md`: Links to the presentation slides.
- `20XX-01-08-history.md`: Links to past proceedings.

Create sections by adding files within the `_posts` directory.
Hide existing sections by adding the following to the pages's yaml front matter:

```
display: false
```

### Icons

The icons included between each section come from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com).
We are using [version 4.2.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/), but that could easily be changed by updating the [version downloaded by the layout](https://github.com/hust-workshop/hust-workshop.github.io/blob/f3467c98171d8e8e4277f7f63fc000bb5ed4cebc/_layouts/default.html#L11).
